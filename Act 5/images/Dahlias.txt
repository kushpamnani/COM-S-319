The spectrum of color offered by red-flowering Dahlias is extraordinary, spanning bold, fire-truck tones; bright orange-reds; romantic, wine-colored burgundy and maroon shades; and the captivating, nearly black hues of the darkest Dahlias. We confess to loving them all. Choose the shades you like best and combine them with Dahlias in other colors and forms to add bold highlights to the late summer and autumn garden and to create gorgeous, oh-so-easy bouquets.
